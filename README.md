# Walmart-retail-insights-optimization
Analyzed sales growth, customer segmentation, and product
 performance using advanced MySQL queries. I identified top
performing branches, profitable product lines, and anomalies in
 sales transactions to improve strategies. I segmented customers
 into spending tiers, identified repeat buyers, and analyzed
 payment preferences by city. I delivered actionable insights
 through SQL-driven analysis, enhancing decision-making with
 clear visualizations and reports
